## Work process

<hr>

Always work from you own local branch named appropriately.

Create a new branch from main: git checkout -b <branch name>

Ex branch name:
- task/1111-user-can-logout
- bug/2222-reserve-order-fail
- improvement/3333-refactor-error-messages
- design/4444-login-component

Keep your pull requests small. When working on bigger tasks, dived your work into smaller units.
Never push anything directly to master or main branch.
There are situations when your pull request gets rather big, then consider asking more than one collegue to review you code.
